# stdlib
An opinionated shell library for macOS

## Usage

Place the `stdlib` file somewhere easily accessible and add the following line to your shell script to make use of the various functions.

```
#!/bin/bash

source /path/to/stdlib

...
```

## Why?

I found I was always repeating myself or finding previous scripts to copy/paste. I could have easily made Clippings of these for BBEdit but I wanted something portable and able to be pushed to clients for use in other scripts.
